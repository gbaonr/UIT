    "In the previous labs, we tried our hand at supervised and unsupervised anomaly detection using XGBoost and Deep Autoencoders on the KDD-99 network intrusion dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "We addressed the issue of unlabelled training data through the use of Deep Autoencoders in the second lab. However, unsupervised methods such as PCA and Autoencoders tend to be effective only on highly correlated data such as the KDD dataset, and these algorithms might also require the data to follow a Gaussian Distribution.\n",

    "> \"Adversarial training (also called GAN for Generative Adversarial Networks), and the variations that are now being proposed, is the most interesting idea in the last 10 years in ML, in my opinion.\".\n",
    "> Yann LeCun, 2016.\n",
    "\n",
    "What do GANs bring to the table and how are they different from Deep Autoencoders?\n",
    "\n",
    "GANs are generative models that generate samples similar to the training dataset by learning the true data distribution. So instead of compressing the input into a latent space and classifying the test samples based on the reconstruction error, we actually train a classifier that outputs a probability score of a sample being Normal or Anomalous. As we will see later in the lab, this has positioned GANs as very attaractive unsupervised learning techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "GANs can be pretty tough to train and improving their stability is an active area of research today."

    "- We successfully employed state of the art Generative Adversarial Networks for anomaly detection on high dimensional data such as the KDD dataset.\n",
    "- The GAN is particularly interesting  because it sets up a supervised learning problem in order to do unsupervised learning. While it generates fake data, and tries to determine if a sample is fake or real based on trivial labels, it really does not know what the different classes in the dataset are.\n",
    "- On the downside, GANs can be tough to train and suffer from convergence issues particularly because, the discriminator during training does not learn as much from the true dataset as it learns to distinguish between the probability distributions."
